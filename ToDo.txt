LAG
  DONE -Would likely be much faster if volume was only added to specific cell labels,
      rather than iterating and refreshing the entire column every cycle.
  -App still gets very laggy after a certain period. Need to get to the bottom of this.

  DONE??? HUGE DELAY ---- FIX IT
  -implement .after() into all funcs to see if it improves performance
      (it was actually in issue of calling too many functions with .after() recursion,
      so it just added more and more recursive functions firing with each cycle.)



IDEAS

DONE -Price ladder column cells as dictionary items???
    DONE -Would allow for more info to be stored about each.


PRICE AXIS

    DONE -Make highlight_trade_price() activate on recenter/refresh, there are leftover highlights when function is called
    DONE -Add selective auto-recenter
    DONE -Make highlighted price label actually reflect changing current price (not just stuck on the first price change on init)
    DONE -Make highlighted price move within column
    DONE -Build price axis grid
    DONE -Populate grid with price dictionary


VOLUME COLUMN
    -Add proportional volume bars behind (or below?) quantity label as representation of size


TOOLBAR

    DONE -Add functionality to Recenter button

ORDER COLUMN
    -Getting orders is very slow.
        -get_open_orders() potentially being called multiple times?
        -Need to stop it from printing the request data.

    -Implement Binance user account functionality
        -Display account balance
        -Display orders
        -Add Buy
        -Add Sell
        -Cancel individual
        -Cancel all
