LAG
  -Would likely be much faster if volume was only added to specific cell labels,
    rather than iterating and refreshing the entire column every cycle.
  -App still gets very laggy after a certain period. Need to get to the bottom of this.

  DONE??? HUGE DELAY ---- FIX IT
  -implement root.after() into all funcs to see if it improves performance


DONE -Build price axis grid
DONE -Populate grid with price dictionary


IDEAS
-Price ladder column cells as dictionary items???
  -Would allow for more info to be stored about each.


PRICE AXIS
  -Add selective auto-recenter
  -Make highlighted price label actually reflect changing current price (not just stuck on the first price change on init)
  -Make highlighted price move within column


VOLUME COLUMN
  -Add proportional volume bars behind (or below?) quantity label as representation of size


TOOLBAR
  DONE -Add functionality to Recenter button
