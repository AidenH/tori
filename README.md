# tori

tori is a price ladder trading application built for cryptocurrency markets (currently only supporting the Binance Perpetual Futures market).
I wrote this application with the intention of filling gaps that I felt were present
within the feature lists of many widely popular proprietary DOM platforms on the
market today. This includes not only technical gaps such as scalable
(but not synthetic) tick sizing, volume cleaning, and reliable entry display, but
also accessibility gaps, namely in the form of prohibitive pricing.
